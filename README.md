# Is It Vegan? 🌱

A vibe coding experiment to analyze products and determine if they're vegan using AI.

## What is Vibe Coding? 🎨

Vibe coding in Cursor is about leveraging AI to enhance the development process through effective prompting. It's about:

- Writing clear, specific prompts that guide the AI to understand your intent
- Iterating on code with natural language feedback
- Maintaining a conversational flow with the AI assistant
- Using the AI to explore different approaches and solutions
- Balancing AI assistance with human judgment and creativity

In this project, we use vibe coding to create an intuitive product analyzer, focusing on clear communication with the AI to build a user-friendly interface and reliable analysis system.
