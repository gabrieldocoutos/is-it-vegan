# Is It Vegan? 🌱

A vibe coding experiment to analyze products and determine if they're vegan using AI.

## What is Vibe Coding? 🎨

Vibe coding is a development approach that prioritizes the experience and feeling of the code, not just its functionality. It's about:

- Creating with intuition and natural flow
- Focusing on user experience and aesthetics
- Developing with a greater purpose in mind
- Maintaining a pleasant and inspiring development environment
- Valuing both the process and the end result

In this project, we apply vibe coding to create a pleasant and intuitive experience for checking if products are vegan, while maintaining clean code and a friendly interface.
